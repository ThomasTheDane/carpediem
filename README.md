A event sharing system

ideas
-----

I am writing this on 4/4/2014 at noon. These are the ideas that I have had so far for the project as a whole. The idea is that events are currently something that is not tracked very well by anyone. The inspiration came from olin carpe mailing list, which is really disorganized and non-functional. If people could put out carpes or helpmes to a subset community, it would all a lot of benefits. 

Feature ideas:
iCal integration for events
Ability to generate carpe emails from site 
iPhone/ android apps
web app
integration with facebook
perhaps for olin; integration with email lists?
Exclusion dynamics (eg. required @college/work email)
Groupings
Map view (google maps, pins(see below) and user loc)
List View ; (title, desc, location / distance, time)
A when is good style setup for creating events
Critical Mass: This event will happen with X people
notification to let user know if event is cancelled or not
Limit: This event has a max of Y people. 
Level of interested metric (eg. Will absolutely be there, may be there, want to be)
Determining the nearest Jumpspot for users
Different Jumpspot classifications (eg. event, free stuff, free food)
Groups can have administrators who can kick out creepers / trolls
Groups can be set up to require people who join to be confirmed by admin
User profiles - for event leaders who host many events
Ability to follow the events of profiles 
integrate with google hangout to make virtual spots
Pin color reflecting event time
red pins would indicate an event starting very soon, green pin would indicate an event starting later
Unordered: 
Some way to make carpe look really nice (photo, fonts, formatting) 
Some way to add comments or notifications to event
